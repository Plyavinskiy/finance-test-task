# React Test Task

## Requirements

We need you to implement a solution to display price tickers data on the UI in realtime.

Price data is available from a locally running service (see information below). Any additional visualisations to indicate how prices have changed would be a plus. Testing is also an important part to this exercise.

Requirements:
- application should connect to the locally running service
- application should render price changes for some tickers in real time

You can get some ideas how your application may look like on the [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/) page.

As a bonus you can implement (please describe implemented bonus functionality in this file):
- any additional visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices
- the possibility to switch on/off tickers by user
- the possibility to specify interval time by user
- the possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group
- any additional functionality you consider useful

You should use the next technologies:
- React (preferable with hooks)
- Redux (with Redux-Thunk or any other Redux middleware you are familiar) or any other state-manager library you want
- Socket.io - to connect to the service
- any UI library you want, or you can use just pure CSS
- Testing Library

We will assess the next parts:
- workability: how your application works
- projects structure: how you structure your files
- code quality: how you write clean, readable code (feel free to install and use ESLint and Prettier)
- knowledge React and its ecosystem: how you compose and use libraries together
- testing: how you can test your code

## Running the local service
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd server```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```
5. You can visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to check that the service is working correctly and inspect the data it produces.

## Run your application
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd client```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

## Run the tests
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd client```
3. ```npm run test``` or ```yarn test```

# Price Service Usage

URL:
```http://localhost:4000```

Price tickers are real-time via web-sockets.

## Example JSON Response from the Price Ticker service
```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "exchange": "NASDAQ",
    "price": 279.29,
    "change": 64.52,
    "change_percent": 0.84,
    "dividend": 0.56,
    "yield": 1.34,
    "last_trade_time": "2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"
  },
  {"ticker":"GOOGL","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":237.08,"change":154.38,"change_percent":0.10,"dividend":0.46,"yield":1.18,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"MSFT","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":261.46,"change":161.45,"change_percent":0.41,"dividend":0.18,"yield":0.98,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"AMZN","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":260.34,"change":128.71,"change_percent":0.60,"dividend":0.07,"yield":0.42,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"FB","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":266.77,"change":171.92,"change_percent":0.75,"dividend":0.52,"yield":1.31,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"TSLA","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":272.13,"change":158.76,"change_percent":0.10,"dividend":0.96,"yield":1.00,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"}
]
```

The tickers we use:
- **AAPL** - Apple
- **GOOGL** - Alphabet
- **MSFT** - Microsoft
- **AMZN** - Amazon
- **FB** - Facebook
- **TSLA** - Tesla

## Information regarding implementation details, requirements, and preferred technologies
=========================================================================================
1. Highlighted columns with metrics in red and green colors.
2. Added arrows, +/- and $ for metrics columns.
3. Added colors for ticker abbreviations, but only existing ones. There were 2 ideas:

1) It was possible to generate colors and assign randomly for new tickers, but I assumed that tickers in reality, most likely, should have fixed colors.

2) It was possible to assign the same colors to all tickers, including new ones, but then the highlighting loses its meaning.

I wanted to remove the colors that I added in order to get away from the hardcode, but there are colors on the site at the link specified in the task, and itâ€™s nicer to debug the UI with them, so I decided to leave them.

4. Provided a modal where you can add new tickers. I did not add a decryption field so as not to edit the server. I didn't bother with flowers either. The button becomes active when text is entered. To exit the modal window, click anywhere on the screen or press Esc.

# All the main listed functionality is also implemented
-------------------------------------------------------
1. You can hide tickers with the Hide button and display them with the SHOW HIDDEN TICKERS button located on the ticker table.

2. You can choose the interval from preset values. I decided not to provide the ability to set an arbitrary interval, because It is more convenient for the user to work with preset settings.

3. You can add tickers (via modal) and delete (using the button with a cross provided in each line of the table).

- It was possible to provide charts that are presented on some American exchanges, or provide a separate portfolio for stocks, but to do everything well, you need to dive into the topic of trading, which takes time.

4. From technologies I used React, Redux, Redux-Toolkit, Socket.io, Material UI, React Testing Library.

5. I also set up ESLint and Prettier.
